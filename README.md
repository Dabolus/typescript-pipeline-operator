## Pipeline Operator in TypeScript

This repo is just a simple example showing off how you can use the Pipeline 
Operator in TypeScript thanks to Babel and its TypeScript preset.

This example will use the Pipeline Operator, but the same concept applies to 
any stage < 3 proposal that hasn't been implemented in TypeScript yet.

1. Install the deps:
   ```bash
   $ yarn install
   ```
2. Build the TS file using babel:
   ```bash
   $ yarn build
   ```
3. Run it!
   ```bash
   $ yarn start
   # or simply:
   $ node pipeline.js
   ```
